after copy XPlane2Blender to addon folder, you have to enable the addon firstly, in Blender User Preference

remember to save your settings, and restart Blender
**Some tips for you when you play with XPlane2Blender**

**Scale=1.0**

after you scaled objects with key 'S', you scales parameters will be changed, which is other than 1.0

you should use 'Ctrl+A' to reset your scale parameter to 1.0, because XPlane2Blender only works fine with scale=1.0
**Metric**

I recommend you to use metric

Blender 3D view, a grid is 1 meter, and Xplane OBJ8 distance is in meter as well. it is easier for you to measure the object or distance.

but one thing I found is Blender 1 meter is not perfectly equal to XPlane 10 OBJ meter. I will investigate it further
**Bake Animation**

please always bake animation, which makes easier to delete bones dependency
