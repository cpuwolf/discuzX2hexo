I've recently installed 10.50.  Unreal.  Why look forward already?  I uninstalled all the Microsoft ###### on my computer, freed up 190GB and am never looking back at anything that has Prepar3d in the title or MSFS.  XPlane is simply the most realistic sim I've ever used.  I have around 10k hours in real airplane time and this has become a nice way to stay in the seat as a hobby since its no longer a "job".  I'm beyond impressed with how some of the FMS's software is so real and so accurate.  Jardesign's XLife is also a great addon.  Lots of work was put into that program and it shows.
